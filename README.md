# ViperbotsMatchAnalyzer
Constantly updated FTC Match Analyzation Software originally created by Spencer Sharp and Ethan McCosky. 
The project is currently maintained by Spencer Sharp, Ethan McCosky.

This software allows teams to analyze the level of teams at the competition based solely on final match results. The beauty of this software is that it works quite accurately with just final scores and doesnt require intensive stand scouting. It is a great resource for rookie teams and those just starting data analysis.

After the numbers are crunched, the rankings show the following data points:
-Rank
-Team Name and Number
-MMR (More on this in a bit)
-Average Score (with Alliance Partner, uses standard deviation)
-Predicted score range (again, relies on a variant of standard deviation)
-Consistency (average difference between each score and the average score)
-Average MMR of partners (Pretty self-explanatory)
-BVM Ratio (A complicated combination of MMR, Avg Score, Consistency, and QP)
-QP/RP (In order to compare to the competition rankings)
